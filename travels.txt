It sort of pains me and also soothes me to think about traveling after a year of
literally zero travel. I think some of my favorite trips really are not all that
extravagant. My best trips have all been cruising around on long road trips, and
camping in national parks. I think my favorites of all time are Mt. Rainier,
Grand Teton, and Yosemite.
